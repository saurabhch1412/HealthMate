Description

We have recently developed a Healthcare application that aims to provide seamless access to healthcare facilities remotely. The app features a user-friendly interface and allows users to register and login using Google Firebase authentication, ensuring the safety and security of their personal information.

Once logged in, users can access the "Find Lab" feature, which enables them to book lab and pathology services as per their convenience, remotely. This feature comes in handy for people who find it challenging to visit labs and clinics for appointments, especially those living in rural areas. Users can book appointments according to their preferred dates and time slots.

In addition to this, the app also offers a feature to buy common medicines and get them delivered to the user's doorstep. This feature makes it easy for users to order and receive medicines without having to visit pharmacies.

Another essential feature of the app is the "Find Doctor" feature, which allows users to locate top doctors available remotely in their locality as per their requirements. The user's data is saved in real-time in the Google Cloud Platform database, ensuring quick access to user data whenever needed.

After placing an order, users can view the details in the "Order Details" page, which fetches data from Firebase, as entered by the user. The app also includes a BMI calculator that shows the exact BMI of the user and changes its color according to the user's weight status, i.e., normal, underweight, or overweight.

To cater to the visually impaired users, we have integrated machine learning and TensorFlow data model to build an object detecting software that can detect objects from images captured by the users as well as from the gallery. When a visually impaired user captures an image or selects an image from the gallery, the object detector analyzes the image and identifies the objects present in it. The user can then listen to the object names using text-to-speech technology, which converts the object names into speech. It is a significant addition to the Healthcare application, as it enables visually impaired users to identify objects and navigate the world more easily. With this feature, we hope to make a meaningful difference in the lives of visually impaired individuals.

Moreover, the app also features a "Health Articles" section that provides users with enough knowledge about current hot topics related to health. Users can access this section to stay informed about the latest developments in the healthcare sector.

Finally, we have also included a chatbot using "Dialogflow," which is powered by Google Cloud Platform, to provide instant solutions to users' doubts and frequently asked questions.

In summary, our Healthcare application aims to provide comprehensive healthcare facilities to users remotely. Our healthcare Android application offers an excellent set of features that make it easier for patients to access healthcare remotely, making it a valuable addition to the healthcare ecosystem.

Thank You.
